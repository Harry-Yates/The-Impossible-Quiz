# The Impossible Quiz

---

Hyper Island - If this, then that Module - Brief 2.

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

- Use firebase to create a quiz where all the answers are stored and compared.

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

2 weeks.

### :dart: Goals:

- Integrate firebase dependencies and draw questions from stored data.
- Develop improved Git workflow work on branches individually.
- Use agile/scrum/kanban methodologies.
- Improve our folder structure and SCSS workflow.
- Challenge our JS knowledge and look to develop skills.

### :mechanical_arm: Solution:

The idea behind this project was to have a quiz that used questions stored in firebase.

A nice to was to have a 'modifier devil' that would make the straightforward quiz MUCH HARDER! 😈

Modifiers would blur answers, add confusing animations and mess with the quiz user.

Our focus on the project was group learnings, so although we completed the core brief, we ran out of time to add our evil modifiers.

### :man_student: Learnings:

- Deeper understanding of JS.
- Vastly improved folder structure and approach to working with SCSS.
- Improved use of Git Hub - worked smoothly on separate branches.
- Use of Figma was efficient and quick.
